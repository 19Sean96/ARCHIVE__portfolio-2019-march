# Web Portfolio - Made 2019, March
## Notes
**SEIZURE WARNING - A lot of moving patterns & colors**
1. This was my first "real attempt" at making a portfolio website. 
2. Starting making this during my 6th week of bootcamp, so you'll notice it's...kinda goofy. Intersection observers are off, UI has terrible responsiveness, color placed hapazardly as I went. 
3. Still one of my favorites due to my experience level at that point where I was still "experimenting" - testing the boundaries of the Notorious D.O.M. Mouse tracing, scroll tracking, etc. - everything was brand new to me. I was like a kid in a playground who was given a 100+ color crayon pack and told to "go wild".
